My name is Jotham. I'm a 🖥️ computer scientist and a multidisciplinary 🎨 artist based in the 🇵🇭 Philippines. I graduated _summa cum laude_ at the University of the Philippines Los Baños.

My favortite medium is 📷 photography, and I often use the aesthetics of my time to express myself. As a computer scientist, I am primarily interested in computer graphics and light transport.

I've worked with Dashlabs and interned at the Visual Media Lab in KAIST. I was previously an instructor at the Institute of Computer Science in the University of the Philippines.

I aspire to be a graphics researcher and engineer, a best-selling artist, and a game developer all rolled into one! I am currently learning things from the bottom-up— think **Vulkan**, **real-time graphics**, **AI**, **engine programming** and **game design**! If we have the same interests, feel free to connect! 

You can have a look at my projects here at GitHub or in my [personal website](https://renejotham-dev.vercel.app/).
